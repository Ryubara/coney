# Building and testing

This page takes you from a fresh clone to a built, tested Coney on Windows, Linux or macOS, and covers the Python
tools, the documentation and the checks CI runs on every pull request. The rules the code itself follows are in
[Conventions](conventions.md); where to put your game files and tools is in [Local workspace](workspace.md).

Nothing here needs the game. The build and every test run on synthetic data, so you can build and test Coney
before you have a disc image at all.

## What you need

| | Windows | Linux | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compiler | MSVC 19.38+ (Visual Studio 2022 17.8 or Build Tools 2022) | GCC 13+ or Clang 19+ | Xcode 16+ |
| CMake 3.28+ and Ninja | bundled with Visual Studio | distribution packages | Homebrew |
| Git | yes | yes | yes |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | for the Python tools and pre-commit | same | same |

The C++ dependencies (SDL3, librw, Catch2) are not installed by hand: CMake downloads them on the first configure,
at the exact commits pinned in `cmake/deps.cmake`. That first configure needs network access and takes a few
minutes; later builds reuse the copies under `build/<preset>/_deps/`.

Clang 17 and 18 are supported by the language rules but not on Linux with libstdc++: libstdc++ only declares
`std::expected` when the compiler reports full C++20 concepts support, which Clang first does in version 19. Use
Clang 19 or newer there.

### Windows

Install Visual Studio 2022 or the Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 with the **Desktop development with C++**
workload. It brings MSVC, CMake and Ninja; you do not need to install them separately.

The compiler and those tools are on `PATH` only inside a shell with the MSVC environment loaded. Either open the
**x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022** from the Start menu, or run `vcvars64.bat` in an existing
`cmd` shell:

```bat
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
```

For a Visual Studio install, replace `BuildTools` with your edition (`Community`, `Professional` or `Enterprise`)
and `Program Files (x86)` with `Program Files`. Every `cmake` and `ctest` command below runs from that shell.

### Linux

On Ubuntu 24.04 (other distributions have the same packages under similar names):

```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build g++-13 \
  libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxfixes-dev libxi-dev libxss-dev libxtst-dev \
  libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libdbus-1-dev libudev-dev
```

The second and third lines are what SDL3 needs to build its X11 and Wayland video drivers. For Clang, install
`clang-19 clang-tools-19` in place of `g++-13`; `clang-tools-19` brings `clang-scan-deps`, which CMake runs on C++23
sources when the compiler is Clang. Pick the compiler with `CC` and `CXX` before the first configure:

```sh
export CC=clang-19 CXX=clang++-19
```

A build directory remembers its compiler, so to switch compilers later, delete `build/<preset>/` first.

### macOS

Install Xcode 16 or newer (or its command line tools with `xcode-select --install`), then:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja
```

## Build and test

Everything goes through the presets in `CMakePresets.json`. The everyday loop is:

```sh
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
```

The first line only needs running again when a `CMakeLists.txt` or `cmake/deps.cmake` changes in a way the build
does not pick up by itself. Each preset builds into its own `build/<preset>/` folder, so presets never disturb each
other.

| Preset | Build type | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | Debug | day-to-day work |
| `release` | RelWithDebInfo | an optimised build that can still be debugged |
| `ci` | Debug, warnings as errors | what CI builds; run it before a pull request |
| `asan` | Debug, warnings as errors, AddressSanitizer and UBSan | memory and undefined-behaviour bugs; Linux and macOS only |

`ctest` runs the Catch2 unit tests (`coney_tests`) and three smoke tests of the `coney` executable itself: it starts
and stops headless, prints its help, and refuses a bad argument.

## Run Coney

The executable is `build/<preset>/src/platform/coney` (`coney.exe` on Windows). Run with no arguments, it opens an
empty window and runs until you close it. There is nothing to see yet; the window and the engine start-up are the
skeleton later work builds on.

```text
coney [--frames N] [--help]
```

`--frames N` stops after N frames, which is how tests and scripts run it. To run it with no display at all, as CI
does, select SDL's dummy video driver:

```sh
SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER=dummy build/dev/src/platform/coney --frames 3
```

In PowerShell, set the variable first with `$env:SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER = "dummy"`.

## Sanitizers

The `asan` preset builds with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer and runs the tests under them. Any
report fails the test that caused it.

```sh
cmake --preset asan
cmake --build --preset asan
ctest --preset asan
```

LeakSanitizer reads its suppressions from `tests/lsan.supp`, which hides one known leak inside librw and nothing in
Coney's own code. Suppressions match function names, so the sanitizer must be able to name the frames in a report.
GCC's and Apple Clang's runtimes do that on their own. Clang on Linux needs `llvm-symbolizer`: install the `llvm-19`
package and point the runtime at it, or librw's leak goes unrecognised and the tests fail.

```sh
export ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-19/bin/llvm-symbolizer
```

The preset is not offered on Windows: MSVC's AddressSanitizer has no UBSan and no LeakSanitizer, so it would check
much less than the Linux and macOS runs that CI does anyway.

## clang-tidy

CI runs clang-tidy 19 over Coney's own sources (`src/` and `tests/`, never the fetched dependencies), using the
`compile_commands.json` that every preset writes. To run the same check locally on Linux, after a `ci` build with
Clang 19:

```sh
run-clang-tidy-19 -p build/ci -quiet '^(?!.*_deps).*/(src|tests)/'
```

## Python tools

`python/` is the `coney-tools` package (see [Conventions](conventions.md#python)). [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
installs the right Python and the locked dependencies into `python/.venv` the first time you run something:

```sh
uv run --project python coney-tools --help
uv run --project python pytest python/tests
uv run --project python ruff check python
uv run --project python mypy python/src python/tests
```

`coney-tools config show` prints the paths your `coney.local.toml` sets (start from `coney.local.example.toml`;
[Local workspace](workspace.md) explains each one). `coney-tools repo check-title` checks a commit or pull request
title against the commit rules in [CONTRIBUTING.md](repo:CONTRIBUTING.md#commits).
`coney-tools wad` reads the archive on your own disc (`info`, `list`, `extract`, `names`); [The coney-tools command
line](coney-tools.md) shows how to run each command.

## Formatting and pre-commit

clang-format decides the layout of C and C++ code, ruff that of the Python package, and a few hooks catch trailing
whitespace, broken YAML or TOML, merge-conflict markers and files over 512 KB (usually game data added by mistake).
All of them run through [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```sh
uvx pre-commit run --all-files
```

Run that before every commit, or install the hooks once with `uvx pre-commit install` so that `git commit` runs them
for you. The hooks fix what they can; stage their changes and commit again.

## Documentation

This site is built with MkDocs from `docs/`. In a virtual environment at the repository root:

```sh
py -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
.venv/Scripts/python -m mkdocs build --strict
```

On Linux and macOS use `python3 -m venv .venv` and `.venv/bin/` in place of `.venv/Scripts/`.
`mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127.0.0.1:8000` previews the site and reloads it as you edit. `--strict` turns broken links
and pages missing from the navigation into errors, as CI does. How to write the pages is in
[Writing these docs](writing-docs.md).

## What CI runs

Every pull request, and every push to `main` or a `release/` branch, runs these GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Jobs |
| --- | --- |
| `build` | `ci` preset build and tests on Windows (MSVC), Linux (GCC 13 and Clang 19) and macOS (Apple Clang); `asan` preset on Linux Clang 19 and macOS; clang-tidy; pre-commit over every file |
| `python` | ruff, mypy, pytest and `coney-tools repo check` on Windows, Linux and macOS |
| `docs` | `mkdocs build --strict`, markdownlint over every Markdown file, actionlint over the workflows |
| `pr` | the pull request title against the commit title rules (pull requests only) |

If a job fails, the commands above reproduce it locally. The workflow files under `.github/workflows/` are short and
list every step.
