# The coney-tools command line

`coney-tools` is Coney's own command line (see [Conventions](conventions.md#python)). This page covers the `wad`
group, which reads the game's archive, `WARRIORS.DIR` and `WARRIORS.WAD`, from **your own disc**. Everything is
read in place and streamed, so the 1.4 GB WAD is never loaded into memory. The format is described in
[WARRIORS.DIR / .WAD](../research/formats/wad-dir.md).

Run the commands from inside the checkout:

```sh
uv run --project python coney-tools wad --help
```

## Naming the disc

Every `wad` command takes the disc as an optional first argument, `DISC`:

* a **folder**: a mounted disc (`H:\` on Windows, `/mnt/disc` on Linux) or any folder that holds `WARRIORS.DIR`,
  `WARRIORS.WAD` and, for `names`, `SLUS_212.15`;
* an **`.iso` image** (ISO 9660, 2048-byte sectors). Coney reads it with its own small reader.

Without `DISC`, the tools use `game_dir` from your `coney.local.toml` (see
[Local workspace](workspace.md)). Problems print one line, `coney-tools: <what is wrong>`, and exit with code 2.

## info

```sh
uv run --project python coney-tools wad info [DISC] [--names FILE]
```

Prints the entry count, the total size of the entries and of the WAD, a count of entries by their first four bytes
(a rough content breakdown; printable ones show as text) and how many entries a names file resolves.

## list

```sh
uv run --project python coney-tools wad list /path/to/WARRIORS.iso --names ../../scratch/names.txt
```

One line per entry: index, offset, size, the hash as 8 hex digits and the name when the names file knows it.

## names

```sh
uv run --project python coney-tools wad names [DISC] ../../scratch/names.txt
```

Recovers names: it takes file-name-like strings from `SLUS_212.15` and from every WAD entry, hashes each as
`./ee_files/<name>` (CRC-32 of the lowercased text, [Name hashing](../research/name-hash.md)) and keeps those that
match an entry. It writes one name per line to the output file and prints how many it found. It takes a few
minutes because it reads the whole WAD. Whether a names list may be published is an open legal question, so the
tool always recovers the names from your disc and the list is never committed.

## extract

```sh
uv run --project python coney-tools wad extract [DISC] ../../scratch/wad [--names FILE] [--only HASH_OR_NAME ...]
```

Writes entries into the output folder. A file is named by its recovered name, otherwise `<hash>.bin`. `--only`
takes entry hashes (8 hex digits) or names (`global.lua`), and without it every entry is written, about 1.4 GB.

!!! warning "Game data stays out of the checkout"
    `extract` and `names` refuse an output path inside the repository, because extracted files are game data and
    must never be committed ([LEGAL.md](repo:LEGAL.md#no-game-data)). Use a
    folder beside the checkout, such as `../../scratch/`.
